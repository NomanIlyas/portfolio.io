One of my notable achievements in <b> Laravel</b> development includes implementing a Subscription flow for a finance Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. This project was completed during my tenure at Techloyce organization.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In my role at Techloyce, I successfully architected and built this Subscription flow, ensuring that it seamlessly integrated into the finance CRM, providing a smooth and reliable user experience.          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            My extensive experience with <b> Symfony</b> spans more than 5 years, covering various versions from 3.4 to 5.2. I contributed significantly to projects while working at Coeus Solution and 4-art Technologies. In addition to my Symfony work, I also ventured into Image processing using Python and spearheaded API development in Symfony. This allowed me to create robust and efficient APIs to support complex business processes.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Furthermore, I was part of the development team at Jeeny, a popular Middle East mobile ride-hailing application. During my tenure there, I worked with the<b> Slim framework </b>, particularly Slim 4. I was tasked with optimizing the application structure to handle a high volume of daily requests, ensuring the delivery of fast and reliable APIs.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            My portfolio reflects my dedication to delivering quality and efficient solutions using PHP and these prominent frameworks. I'm enthusiastic about contributing my expertise to your next project.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </ModalBox>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div :class=\"active == 2 ?

One of the standout examples of my optimization work was during my tenure with the EKomi project. The project encountered server timeouts and memory exhaustion issues due to the immense task of importing millions of records on a daily basis. I took on the challenge of optimizing the importer, which played a critical role in this process. I initiated an ongoing optimization process, reengineering the import mechanism from JSON to CSV. This transformation allowed for more efficient data processing. I implemented CSV streaming, which divided the records into manageable chunks, processing 1000 lines at a time. If the data size exceeded 100MB, I further subdivided it into 50MB portions, ensuring that server performance remained stable. This solution not only resolved the server issues but also significantly improved the import process's speed and reliability.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            In addition to server-side optimizations, I possess the expertise to optimize WordPress websites. My skills in this area were exemplified during my collaboration with a US-based graphic agency, Creative Repute. Their requirement for pixel-perfect work didn't deter me; instead, I embraced the challenge and optimized WordPress websites to achieve Google PageSpeed Insight scores consistently above 90. This achievement not only showcased my commitment to delivering high-performance websites but also my ability to meet demanding quality standards, ensuring a seamless user experience. My passion for optimization and my knack for finding effective solutions have been integral to my success in software development\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </ModalBox>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div :class=\"active == 4 ?
